            <p>I am a Front-end developer based in Munich, Germany. I enjoy helping designers and companies bring their
                ideas into real life. I am looking forward to continuing my developer career with a job in a junior web
                developer position.

                If you think Iâ€™d be a good match for your projects, contact me!</p>
